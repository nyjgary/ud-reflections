When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- To share and collaborate on work with others; prevent losing work if local machine is damaged / stolen 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- We might not want to pull the changes in the remote repository (for instance if we are modifying the app to create our own version of the app, automatic update might overwrite changes that we made), and even if we do want the changes, manual commits make us more cognizant of the changes we pulled 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Clone makes copy of the repository; fork is a special case of clone where the cloning is done automatically by Github from one account to another (used when we want to use and modify someone elseâ€™s code by giving them due credit); branch operates within a repository 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- So that we can work offline and note changes that have taken place since last push/pull
