When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- To share and collaborate on work with others; prevent losing work if local machine is damaged / stolen 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- We might not want to pull the changes in the remote repository (for instance if we are modifying the app to create our own version of the app, automatic update might overwrite changes that we made), and even if we do want the changes, manual commits make us more cognizant of the changes we pulled
